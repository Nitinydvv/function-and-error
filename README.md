# Functions and Errors 

## Description

This Solidity smart contract demonstrates the use of `require()`, `assert()`, and `revert()` statements for handling errors and validating conditions. The contract includes various functions that illustrate how these statements can be used in different scenarios.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the smart contract on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Solidity ^0.8.0
- Ethereum development environment (e.g., Remix, Truffle, Hardhat)
- Node.js and npm (for Truffle and Hardhat)

### Installing

Follow the steps below to install and set up the project:

#### Using Remix IDE

1. Open [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
2. Create a new file named `FunctionsAndErrors.sol`.
3. Copy and paste the Solidity code from this repository into the file.
4. Compile the contract using the Solidity compiler version 0.8.0 or later.
5. Deploy the contract using Remix's Deploy & Run Transactions tab.
